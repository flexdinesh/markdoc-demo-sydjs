# Semantic and custom markdown content

## Inline formatting

Bold: **This text is bold**.

Italics: _This text is italics_.

Strikethrough: You can ~~strikethrough~~ text.

Inline code: You can add inline code like this `const hello = "world"`.

## Headings

# H1: Heading One

## H2: Heading Two

### H3: Heading Three

#### H4: Heading Four

##### H5: Heading Five

###### H6: Heading Six

## Paragraph

A standalone single paragraph of text.

Paragraphs can be multiline too when they constitute words that make up more than one line, i.e they wrap to the next line. Wow! I am really smart to write two lines of text that makes zero sense.

## Custom elements in Markdown

### Uh oh, it's not possible!

Only semantic elements listed in [CommonMark spec](https://commonmark.org/help/) can be used in Markdown content.
